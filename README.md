# fuse-swipeorder-sample

Since the Fusetools has not officially supporting drag and drop list orderirng / sorting, so I'm trying to build the workaround using the swipe gesture.
This is not complete replacement for drag and drop list sorting, at least with this kind of solution, I can sort / reoder the list item in interactive way, but one step at a time
The end result is more like playing unblock me :)
